## Prompts that work the best

### Zero‑shot 
```text
Instruction: Given a claim and evidence, determine if the evidence supports or refutes the claim.
Respond with one of the following: "Supports" or "Refutes".

Claim: {{claim}}
Evidence: {{premise}}
Stance:
```

### Few-shot
```text
You are given a claim and evidence. Your task is to determine whether the evidence supports or refutes the claim.
Respond only with one word: "Supports" or "Refutes".

Example 1:
Claim: The sky is blue.
Evidence: Scientists have confirmed that the sky appears blue due to the scattering of light.
Stance: Supports

Example 2:
Claim: Eating fast food is healthy.
Evidence: Studies show that fast food contains high levels of trans fats and sodium, leading to health problems.
Stance: Refutes

Example 3:
Claim: Solar energy reduces electricity costs.
Evidence: Households using solar panels report a significant reduction in electricity bills.
Stance: Supports

Example 4:
Claim: Exercise is harmful to health.
Evidence: Numerous studies show that regular exercise improves cardiovascular health and longevity.
Stance: Refutes

Example 5:
Claim: Climate change is primarily caused by human activity.
Evidence: Recent studies show that over 90% of the increase in greenhouse gases is due to human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation.
Stance: Supports

Example 6:
Claim: Video games can improve cognitive skills.
Evidence: Research indicates that playing strategy games can improve memory, attention, and problem-solving skills.
Stance: Supports

Example 7:
Claim: Exercise has no effect on weight loss.
Evidence: Scientific research consistently shows that physical activity increases energy expenditure and supports weight management.
Stance: Refutes

Example 8:
Claim: Social media has no impact on mental health.
Evidence: Multiple studies have linked social media usage with increased rates of anxiety and depression in teenagers and young adults.
Stance: Refutes

Now analyse the following:

Claim: {{claim}}
Evidence: {{premise}}
Stance:
```

# 🧠 Premise–Claim Linking 

---
Handles **LLM-powered premise–claim linking** using OpenAI and Pydantic.

###  Key Features

- Accepts user input (claims + premises)
- Uses **OpenAI GPT models** with custom prompts to map premises to their corresponding claims
- Identifies stance (`pro` / `con`) and gracefully handles unmatched premises
- Validates all outputs using **Pydantic**, ensuring clean, structured JSON

### Output Format (`output.json`)

```json
{
  "linked_premises": [
    {
      "premise_text": "EVs have zero tailpipe emissions.",
      "stance": "pro",
      "linked_claim_text": "Electric vehicles are better for the environment."
    },
    ...
  ]
}

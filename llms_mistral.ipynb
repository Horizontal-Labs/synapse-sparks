Omni-present, eternal, and immaterial Since CON's assertion was not very clear, Let me try to interpret CON's objection correctly. If CON is trying to say that Cause and effect relations ONLY happen under separate moments in time, then he needs to prove this claim. If CON is instead saying that we don't have a large sample size of causes without spacial or temporal dimensions, then he is wrong because I pointed that human minds have no Spacial or temporal constraints. This was the whole point of showing the mind-body dualism which was unchallenged by CON. Personal Absolute Mind Let me clear up something that I made about this argument. I was not using the existence of abstract objects and human minds as confirmation evidence for my hypothesis. I was trying to falsify it to provide evidence as to why it could not be a human mind or abstract number that created the finely-tuned universe but another entity. Experiments based on falsifying something is another way of providing evidence.

      "Evidence: C6. \"Eternally existing\" makes no sense without time Well first off, CON never explains how he is defining time in the first place. Second, CON again is contradicting himself when he says that eternity is a \"measurement\" of time. Measurements involve limitless and eternity means infinite or limitless amount of time or a timeless entity. As for myself on the other hand, I made it very clear to CON earlier that I was NOT arguing that GOD was \"Chronologically\" prior to the universe but arguing that he had to have been \"Causally\" prior to the Universe. Therefore, when I said God becomes real I did not mean in a temporal sense. Also CON even accepted that cause and effect can be simulatanoues so I don't get why he continues to argue this point. http://en.wikipedia.org... A2. Time must have been \"begun\" The induction method I was using was only there to provide evidence and describe this cause. When it comes to providing evidence of a cause at all, I was using the law of cause and effect which states that everything that begins to exist must have a cause. Therefore, CON will be engaging in what is called the \"Taxi-cab\" fallacy \"when one hops in and assumes a certain system of thought or worldview in an attempt to make a particular point but then jumps out of the system of thought when it suits their fancy\".

PRO accepts this, but says “Just because physicists and philosophers of time believe in the B-theory in survey is NOT evidence or proof that its[sic] true.” Au contraire: consensus of expert opinion is excellent evidence. Across the scales PRO appeals to our folk intuitions: “all of our experiences tell us that the A-theory of time is true” – yet it seems our intuitions regarding the physical world (leave alone the metaphysics of physics) are unreliable (all of my direct experiences tell me the world is not in motion, for example). So my evidence trumps PROs evidence, P2 should be rejected, and the KCA fails. PRO has not responded to my defence of an infinite regress of causes via a hypertask (see my R4). He did talk about BDV theory demonstrating the universe had a past finite boundary, but this isn’t relevant. Hypertasks purport to cram in infinite causal events in a finite length of time, so you can get infinite regresses in finite time, a bit like points in an asymptote.

      "Evidence: OMNI-PRESENT, ETERNAL, AND IMMATERIAL The Law of Cause and Effect states that for every effect there must be a cause for it. In addition, The Law of Biogenesis, attributed to Louis Pasteur, states that life (as we know it) only arises from pre-existing life. Both these physical laws together indicate that whatever is responsible for this complexity and beginning must have been an eternal life force without Spacial and Temporal properties who consciously programmed the first self-replicating DNA molecule along with the universe itself. It must be eternal and therefore changeless without the universe because it created time. Since it also created space, it must transcend space as well and must therefore be dimensionless/immaterial not physical. Lastly, it must be a personal mind since the DNA contains information and ,according to information theory [1], information only comes from minds. Thus, the properties of this cause would be omni-present, eternal, and immaterial as well as a personal force. ABOSOLUTE MIND There are only two possible candidates we are aware of that could possibly have the attributes of an immaterial, omnipresent, eternal and conscious entity: either an abstract object (like numbers) or a human mind (or consciousness). The first candidate are abstract objects. Abstract objects like mathematical entities are not found under rocks or grown out of trees nor are they understood to be contingent upon human minds.

I also want to acknowledge any readers who might have followed the debate to this point. FalsifiabilityIn studying the previous argument, and preparing for my own final statement, I note that my partner seems confused as to the correct meaning of the term “falsifiable.” I had suspected that he was unintentionally misusing the word earlier, but now I am quite certain. Based on the context in which it is used in this final round, I am convinced that he believes that it means “to disprove” something. Consider the wording in this passage, taken from his last argument: Con did not and was not able to falsify this. This does not mean that my hypothesis was unfalsiafiable; it just means he was not able to show it to be false. For the full quote, please read the passage above – but my partner was pointing out that I did not show that the god or goddess that might have made the universe, or how they made it (or something), was “false.” This seems to be important to my partner, who appears to be almost beside himself with frustration at my intransigence.

If there is evidence for something then proving it is usually quite straightforward. The fact that something \"cannot be proved\" would indicate that there is no evidence for it's existence. Exactly. But whose to say that it can not be proved? Lets say for example... Dinosaurs have been proved to have existed... but people ONLY know what they hear or are taught by others. Scientists and people can only prove things in the date span that they are studying in. Whose to say that anyone cant prove the existence of God? God existence was before the existence of man.

      "Evidence: 1. How Old is Christianity? While Christianity is different from Judaism due to the New Testament, the Old Testament is still apart of it. It is the same God, and religion, the Old testament is apart of Christianity, so to say Christianity didn't exist then is false. Christianity just states more recent events that occurred. The New Testament is mostly letters by witness's of God. However the Old Testament is still apart of Christianity. Hence dating Christianity older than Egypt if you go by Biblical dating. As Egypt has been known as \"the black land\", which is also described as the land of Ham in the Bible. Remember the Old Testament is taken as literal history of the New testament. So to say the God of Christianity didn't exist then, would be false, after all it is the same God. 2. Historical Validation As my opponent does not disagree that the Bible has true historic event behind it there isn't much to say about this. However this strongly infers that the Bible hasn't been lost through oral tradition as many historic events that have taken place in the bible continue to be proven true, even once that would be considered rather insignificant, such as the layout of temple that Samson had pushed over. I would also like to point out that it centered around the Middle East. Many people say that God ignored the rest of the world. However from the Middle East it spread to every corner of the world. This may not have happened if it started in say: Hawaii. After all it spread everywhere! Even from the Silk Road. 3 → Token: given → Label: refutes\n"

I have already demonstrated that hearsay can't establish the truth of miracles, so there is not much else that I could say on the matter, at least for now. For the rest of my essay I will try to focus on dissecting your \"proof\" for the existence of God. Despite what you may imagine I have never conceded that your argument for Gods existence was valid. And contrary to what you may believe I didn't ignore your \"proof\" of Gods existence in my second round. I simply stated that even if the premises were valid the conclusions would not follow. ======= Case Pro- Rebuttals ======= Your argument fails for four reasons: 1. The premises of the argument have not been verified therefore the conclusions don't logically follow. 2. If your cosmological argument were valid it wouldn't follow that the \"first cause\" was a \"God\". 3. If we could establish that the first cause was a supernatural \"being\", it would only verify a deistic \"god\" at best. 4. Even If I went completely insane and granted, for the purpose of the argument, that a personal God existed it wouldn't follow that this entity was, \"The God of Christianity\". ========= Contention 1: The premises of your cosmological argument aren't valid. ========= You are using common sense to argue that the universe → Token: given → Label: refutes\n",

It is taken from an assumed hypothesis of \"all things constant\". Further, where did life originate if not from God? Science relies on testing and inference from imperfect human beings whereas, according to Scripture, God is omniscient. Opponent's C-2: According to Scripture, God gave human beings a free will to choose. God, being omnipotent, has the ability to force belief, but rather allows human beings the oppotunity to believe or disbelieve. 1a. Concur, God would like everyone to believe before they die. 1b.

Now, volcanoes are indeed fiery! But, if the volcano you're referring to is Mount Sinai, there is no way it could have looked down upon them. This is based on the fact that the Israelites traveled away from the river for around 20 days before they reached the mountain.[1] Tidal Wave- With regard to the cause of the Egyptians drowning, the Bible does give an answer to the cause of the water moving unnaturally. Exodus 14:21 says \"Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the Lord drove the sea back by a strong east wind all night and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.\" Once again, we see that wind was the cause.

As per the Topic, I am in the affirmative of my resolution that the God of Judaism/Christianity is the ultimate and only confirmable Solipsist. I have made this debate one round per person (1 for Pro, 1 for Con) so that we have one shot to put our arguments forth and let our expressed theories stand on their own (This is to avoid tangents being taken such as God's existence etc) The ontological argument of human existence has many facets, either by chemical chance, matter in motion, causality i.e. action - reaction and so on, or the teleological Theist theory in which God created us and we are the product of that creation by the Almighty. If as solipsism says, the mind is the only truth we can ultimately know, our thoughts are what make up everything we see, hear, touch, smell and taste then God does indeed fall into this category. From a religious perspective God's thoughts do indeed take shape, God thinks it an it occurs. This is made possible by the tenets that Judaism and Christianity attribute to God - Omniscient[1], Omnipotent[2] and Self-sufficient/Self-existent[3] What strikes me as then becoming apparent is that, via religion's assertions and my theory that God would be deemed as the only true solipsist is that - How can we prove our own existence?

Hebrews 6:18 - All God says is true, thus even if he where to say something that wasn't true in our logic; it would become true as it would be spoken into existence. - Lying is sinful; and sin is the absence of God. Thus if God too part in it it would no longer be lying. - There is no reason for God to lie, thus all things are still possible.

Whilst it’s easy to see why this should cost him points for conduct (calling your opponent a ‘dildo’ is hardly good debate etiquette) it should also be a consideration when judging the quality of his arguments. When people resort to screeds so personal abuse it is normally a sign that they have little else to offer – whilst it’s easy to get distracted by Backwardseden’s poor conduct let’s not overlook the fact it’s often done to coverup the fact he doesn’t know how to respond to his opponent’s points. Thus, All my arguments remain unrefuted. Backwardseden’s new argumentBackwardseden uses his closing statement to bring one brand new argument to the table: “Your god would come on down and talk to each and every person on earth to avoid text altogether. ” I disagree; firstly, The God of the Bible values community (e. G 1 Timothy 4:13) and would therefore favour the most collective and communal form of communication available. Secondly, The God of the Bible wants people to willingly accept his existence (John 3:3) and would therefore favour the least coercive form of communication. I therefore submit to you that Backwardseden is wrong in asserting that “text is the worst form of communication.” → Token: given → Label: refutes\n"

No, you would not. You would insist that the jury and the courts make a ruling based on facts and evidence; not one's perception or belief that your loved-one is the murderer. That's how you can save your loved-one from being sentenced to the death penalty. By insisting in evidence and facts. And that's the reality.

Until you do this, your only argument is invalid.Argument #1: Who made God?The answer is that I don't know, but we are not here to discuss how the origins of the universe. We are here to discuss whether the God of the Bible exists or not. You seem to have no objection to the argument I put forward which is that nothing can be eternal. Therefore, God cannot be eternal and must have a cause. Argument #2: No being can be omnipotent My point is that if a being were omnipotent, then surely it would have the ability to make itself stronger. You're correct, that is a paradox. My whole point stands. A being can not be omnipotent.Argument #3: God can't be all-knowing, able to prevent evil and willing to prevent evil.So, God is not willing to prevent evil? So God surely can't be a moral-being, can he? He's able to prevent it evil, but he doesn't but he punishes you for it with eternal torture. How is that a loving or moral God?The thing is that even if you're right and all three arguments are faulty, you still have to provide evidence as you're the one making the positive claim and therefore you have the burden of proof.

At best. \" What I have done is presented evidence which is consistent with and supportive of the claim that the God of the Bible exists. I certainly cannot adequately address every point in relation to the biblical God's existence, so I have chosen to argue from a powerful scientific line of reasoning which supports the account of Genesis where God specially creates every original kind of creature without any sort of gradualistic, step-by-step process. What we find in the study of genetic function and information resoundingly supports this model. Evidence for \"deism\" as Con claims, is still more evidence in support of Jehovah than Con has given in his counter argument to the claim. Con has not argued for the existence of another deity, thus the claim that this God who intelligently designed the original genomes of all living organisms remains uncontested. It would be unfair for Con to present a new argument for the likelihood of another deity in his final round as I would be unable to address his claims.

This has the non-believers being thrown into a lake of fire. God does not kill them, he punishes them. God loves us for being us, but he does not love human nature. I am not human nature. If I was merely human nature, I would have committed many more sins. \"God wants is for humans to act like puppets in accordance to his dogmas. \" God doesn't need us, he wants us.

Well of course first off most of my opponent's definitions are good and I'm not going to challenge any of them so that this does not become a definition debate. However I would like to point out that my opponent himself stated in his attributes of God that God was omnibenevolence. I will expand on this throughout my case. You are taking words in my mouth. According to the Biblical God, is just and all good. This does not mean that He is. The purpose of my debate is to take the characteristics of God, and prove that the God of the Bible is NOT God because he contradicts his very nature. Therefore, I have to prove that he does contradict his nature. Because \"Jesus (who people claim is God) is the same yesterday, and today, and forever\", we know that God is also unchangeable. When we are to examine at is evil we must examine morality. Morality seems simple enough and could be describe as good and evil and such. Yet, where do we get any authority to say that something is immoral. Not only that, we can see that morality CHANGES from one society to another.

The problem is simply that some have declined to accept the Bible as the absolute authority and others have confused what it says because of not\"rightly dividing the Word of truth\" (2 Tim. 2:15). Rightly dividing the word of truth is a key factor here. God is completely moral, true and patient. The Old Testament laws may be viewed as immoral but a stronger lesson must be learned by the ancients views. God perhaps left these old views within the bible so as to better prepare the multitudes and to drive home I bigger and broader sense of moral for future times. God went along with humans and had patience with them in hopes they would learn from their mistakes. It was the social institutions who applied these immoral acts not God. God, on countless occasions, tried to employ other avenues of morality but still had patience with our human ways. Free will comes into play here as well. How long does God wait for change.

But the whole three persons are coeternal, and coequal.

The answer is no. I will specifically make it my objective to prove that the Father and Son are not equal, ignoring the Spirit or Ghost. I only have to prove that two of them are not equal to debunk the entire position.

I am merely stating that if, if, if everything happened as stated, then it is true that God is merciful. But if you wish to turn this into a \"prove this and that\" debate, then I would be more than happy to do so. In fact, I am even better at that type of debate._____________________________________________________________________________________________I clicked on the \"mathematics\" video that is supposed to disprove the flood, and by the time I finished the video, I was astonished by one thing, and that is, that a human is able to achieve the level of ignorance that is required to produce such a piece-of-crap video.I know, those are not very kind words about the author of that video. But I am going to prove that I am right, and that the author of that video, is indeed, a very ignorant person, who does not understand the basics of the flood as taught in the Bible.Here are the arguments that were brought up in the video:(1) all of the species could not possibly board the ark, there is not enough spaceNowhere does the Bible mention species. In fact, species is a term that was invented in the 18th century by Carl Linnaeus, so to say that the term is a part of Genesis, is ridiculous.

      "Evidence: Argument from Biblical Defects (ABD) (P1) If the God of evangelical Christianity were to exist, then the Bible would be God's only written revelation. (P2) Thus, if that deity were to exist, then he would probably see to it that the Bible is perfectly clear and authoritative, and lack the appearance of merely human authorship. (P3) Some facts about the Bible are the following: It contradicts itself or is very unclear in many places. It contains factual errors, including unfulfilled prophecies. It contains ethical defects (such as God committing or ordering atrocities). It contains interpolations (later insertions to the text). Different copies of the same biblical manuscripts say conflicting things. The biblical canon involves disputes and is apparently arbitrary. There is no objective procedure for settling any of the various disputes, especially since the original manuscripts of the Bible have been lost and there has been no declaration from God that would help resolve any of the disputes. (C1) Therefore [from C], the Bible is not perfectly clear and authoritative, and has the appearance of merely human authorship. (C2) Hence [from B & D], probably the God of evangelical Christianity does not exist [1] DiscussionPremise 1 is unproblemetic since God would want to preserve his word.

The bible may or not be based upon the actual words of god, And you're right that regardless some amount of meaning will be lost in the translations. But god can get someone to understand something without using direct and exact words. He doesn't ever use direct and exact words, As far as I know, Apart from what the bible says. Communication could happen when a person in conversation drops a line that has a special significance to the other, Or when someone opens a fortune cookie to find an answer, Or when one flips to a random page in the bible and pokes their finger down randomly, Reading the verse it landed on. Or it could be that as you read the bible, A verse answers your questions. Shaped symbols are as good for sending a message as anything else in the physical world. I've never had any of those happen to me. I don't know how communication by god even works, Because I've never had a miraculous incident happen to me. I've never had anything that jumped out at me and said \"this is too much of a coincidence\" or even \"this is pretty convenient\".

My point stands regardless of whether he implied such a thing or not, besides that he did in fact imply such a thing;\"If we continue to isolate attributes apart from others it is like looking at one wall of the building and saying it is imperfect or perfect. \" Yes he said both perfect and imperfect, but given the resolution, imperfection was obviously the implication I would focus on. It doesn't matter whether you focus on one attribute or God in his entirety, an imperfection is an imperfection regardless. If anything, pro is the one trying to argue semantics here.

Pro didn't specify what part of his source he was using, so I checked out his sources and assumed he was putting forth the strongest argument I saw.

It is the only testament for Jews). It is based off any understanding of God. If He wanted us to do something, He would not tell us through one person. That would be unreasonably cruel. People could not determine if that person was telling the truth. Therefore, they could not be blamed for believing that the prophet was a hoax. I have made this argument before, and you have not refuted it. Additionally, Moses was a political and spiritual leader, as were all the Jewish prophets, but God spoke directly to every living Jew and informed them what He wanted from them, as well as the fact that Moses was in charge.

It does say that slaves shouldn't be mercilessly killed though. -Responses to Con's first section- What is the process is instantanious? This takes up no time at all. And you still didn't prove why it necessitates time. You merely stated it did. Because time doesn't exists. By telling they are different entities/objects. No because nothing can precede anything, time doesn't actually exist. Yes. We came up with the concept of time to explain things more easily. --- All types. To be fair i will rebuttal the clock experiment. The clocks were designed to measure this thing we call \"time\". But it is made up of matter that simply moves on a 3d plane. \"Before\" it reaches it's destination was simply located there. It moved but movement and time don't work together at all. Hence the clock experiment. Moved to different places and were affected by time differently. Time and movement are completely independent from each other. There may be a correlation but they still aren't directly linked in any way proved by the experiment. They are two completely different variables. Therefore motion cannot be used to prove the existense of time. --- When did quantum fluctuations start? --- The next argument by Con is useless. Think of quadratic functions.

We can discuss the argument in a separate debate but in after I am done my rebuttal I will make a debate pertaining the moral argument. Make sure to look for a debate called morality is grounded in God. Okay so I too have struggled with your doubts in the past. My first doubts were due to my sexual orientation being Bisexual and also the Christian involvement in the slave trade. However I realized that the actions of the Church historically don't disprove Christianity and I began examining the arguments against Christianity and could have very well become an Agnostic but thanks to the works of people like Dr. William Lane Craig, Dr. David Wood, Ravi Zacharias, Lee Strobel and others I am a stronger christian than I have ever been and I plan one day to open up a Christian Apologetics Academy in Edmonton, Alberta which is where I live.

My defence was that the kids would die regardless and what is more humane drowning or starvation and being eaten alive.

For example my parents of course were and still are Christians to this day. They made me go to church and I had to have a discussion with them on what I learned from the church pastors at home after services were over and they made me read the Holy Bible from time to time. I would afterwards have to write an essay to my father and have a discussion with parents on what I learned. They made me do the whole nine yards as a Christian because they just thought it was for my own good because they didn't want me to grow up a \"lost soul\". In all honesty I couldn't really get into \"the spirit\" of the religion or it's major god but I wanted to but subconsciously never could get myself to \"have the faith\" that many people on this world have. I had no problem at all with my good parents the problem I was having was a \"lack of faith\" in this diety whose known by some religious followers as \"The Ruler of Heaven\" I wanted this god into my life but I was in denial that this may all be a belief system built on deception.

      "Evidence: Thank you for such a quick reply! RC1: Not everyone in the world trades gold in this way One of the best things that the gold standard does for America is that it gives us a solid currency that other countries can trade with. Some of the countries that we would be trading with do not have gold sold in the public as commonly as we do in America. In fact, only in richer countries such as America do we buy and sell gold among the public as if it's nothing. But most of this is irrelevant because the price of gold is not based on how much is being sold in the public. What changes the price of gold is at what rate it can be mined out of the ground. If gold is becoming rare in a certain year, the price of gold will change. The amount of gold that is in the market will change all the time but it will never be as severe as the production of gold. Therefore, technology could not change the value of gold to a severe extent because it does not affect it's production or how other countries use it. RC2: This is true but even without the gold standard this happens This contention does not pertain to the gold standard specifically as this can happen when the gold standard is not active. As of now your example could take place with America and Kenya: A man buys a product from America with his own currency. He takes his product back to Kenya where it has a lower demand. Another man from China buys the Kenya mans product and because it has high demand in China, the Chinese man walks away with a better deal. This is not because of → Token: given → Label: refutes\n"

      "Evidence: I have a refutation for my opponents claims coming in the next round, unfortunately I have found I did not have time to complete it this round and was racing to complete it with half a day left and so now I will just lay out a small part of my argument. As a result this round will be a little sparse. No countries currently use the gold standard. Instead modern solutions similar to the gold standard are used, this is why nations like China, Russia, Italy, the USA ect stockpile gold reserves [1] not fully on the gold standard but with enough gold reserves to give their currency meaning. When economics experts were in America were polled on this they commented universally that in reality the Gold standard was not something that would have benefit in the US [2]. The main idea of the gold standard is the idea that it provides stability, this is mainly a way of controlling inflation, and the problem with inflation is that it has a link with unemployment [3] [4], therefore when you instigate a policy designed to control inflation you will almost unavoidably massively increase the unemployment rate which would cause chaos in an economy racked by unemployment [5]. So yeah sorry this is a little shorter than probably expected however I will make up for it next time with a full argument and rebuttal.

      "Evidence: Hmmmm. What does boycott mean? I believe it means, in your action atleast, to stop a movie from producing or selling. Not letting someone voice their opinion through a movie is stopping them from being heard. That is Anti-American. Don't buy into it. Great. Their is a difference between not seeing a movie and boycotting it. Pullman has read books about God considering he is good friends with the creator of Narnia. He is an Atheist so he doesn't get offended by your God because he doesn't believe in it. I have never not seen a movie because I disagreed with it, because I'm not ignorant enough to know that they can keep their opinion. I believe Christians are scared of losing Christians because they know what they are doing is wrong and is just scapegoating these movies to make them look good. If you were paying attention you would have seen my definition of ignorant. Someone who has not read the books. Which makes you ignorant. Pullman dislikes organized religion because he believes people should have their own choice of what they want to believe. You didn't know that did you? That makes you ignorant to that fact. That's the point of this debate. The difference between Pullman and Christianity is that Pullman is not trying to silence the Church. He is telling its followers to follow their heart and trust what they believe and no one else should tell you how to. That's so Pro-Christian, it's crazy.\n",

I'm not even sure to begin, since there is no clear direction in your beliefs or thoughts. \"I am arguing that the existence of god is in itself not atheist. Because these books/films acknowledged that God at one point existed in them, they can't be an atheist book or movie.\" The whole point of this series (books & movies) is to promote the atheist agenda. Pullman is taking his target to the innocence of children. The point of these books has nothing to do with the existence of God, as you state. The purpose behind this series is to make God a mythical being. Something that is fictional and able to be killed off. Thus, atheism is present because it has created an illusion of the realism of God. \"Then Pullman is more anti Christianity than he is Atheist.\" This is highly false. In fact, there are Christian themes throughout Pullman's series: Self-sacrifice, love, compassion towards others. The main point of the argument is that the Golden Compass is not an Atheist movie, when it is clearly setup to promote the atheist way of thinking. If a child, who does not know the love of God, watches this movie...their train of thought can be impacted by the idea of killing God, making the all-living mythical for the fact that he/she could be killed.

      "Evidence: My opponent has stopped arguing against the golden rule at all, and continue to strawman it. Their argument is simply an attack on ethics in general. My opponent asks \"Which of these situations is more ethical?\" and expects the Golden Rule to give an obvious, objective, and morally correct answer in every situation. Otherwise, according to my opponent, the Golden Rule is unclear. Unfortunately, this not what clear means. My opponent says the Golden Rule is meant to be subjective. This is correct. There is no objective code in the Golden Rule. Does this make its application unclear? Absolutely not. I will explain prioritization with an analogy: Bob has $1. Bob wants ice cream. He goes to the ice cream stand, and inside he sees two things he wants: an ice cream sandwich and a chocolate dipped cone. They are $1 each. He cannot buy both, so he must ascertain which is more important to him to have. He chooses the sandwich. Such is subjective morality in these cases. With the Golden Rule, one must consider what is most important that they be treated like. It is not objectively moral, like my opponent seems to want, but it is a very clear guideline on subjective morals. If Bob cannot decide which is more important to him, the problem lies with his decision-making skills and not the Golden Rule, as the Golden Rule has told him what to do. My opponent seems not to believe in human ability to combine situations. Bob would not be ignoring one issue or the other, but rather would be considering both → Token: given → Label: refutes\n",

      "Evidence: Clarity PRO has claimed that I stated the Golden Rule is sometimes not clear. This is untrue. Her quote from my words state that the “action” may not be clear, but the Rule itself is quite simple. As PRO never addressed my analogy, and I think I have thought of a better one, I will present it presently. The Golden Rule can be thought of as an incredibly simple mathematical equation; y=x, where y is what I would like to have done to me, and x is what I should do. Most of the time, y is equal to something simple like 2, ½, or 9.3. In these cases, there is no problem. However, in some cases, y is something a little more difficult to deal with, such as i, or π. In these cases, the formula is still as simple as ever (i=i or π= π), even thought the action itself may be difficult to determine. As I have argued from the first round, the Golden Rule is clear, treat others as you wish to be treated. If you don’t know how you wish to be treated, that is not the fault of the Golden Rule Some Random Middle Ground PRO has accused me of choosing “some random middle ground” in the hypothetical situation we were discussing, and also of not stating why my choice was best.

The problems with thinking that is that someone may need to understand ones mind in order to fully comprehend the deprivation for death to be bad. It may not be possible for someone who no longer exists to suffer misfortune. It does not make sense for death to be bad. \"...but only the value of the person who is its' subject.\" Nagel feels that in order to understand ones death, one must understand what the person is like in general. That individual would need to determine what that person has to lose when they die, and that there is a fate worse than death. Think about having to live forever. One would lose touch with themselves and be unable to connect with anyone around them. They would suffer lose on a frequent basis, they would suffer the pain of the monotonous acts of seeing their loved ones die over and over again. \"Her ending of life has come to a state of boredom, indifference, and coldness. Everything is joyless\" \"in the end it is the same,\"...singing in silence.\" What this translates to, is that immortality may be just as unknown and full of sameness as death.

Disagreement is neither ignorant or hypocritical, even if one disagrees strongly. I'm surprised that anyone would try to defend it as being literally correct, but it's fair for Pro try. It is then fair for me to ask \"What is it of which Republicans are ignorant?\" and “What is the evidence that such ignorance characterizes Republicans?” Pro also has to prove hypocrisy. So I ask, \"What is it Republicans believe, but deny believing, that makes them hypocrites?\" and “What is the evidence that particular hypocrisy characterizes Republicans. Pro refuses to answer any of these questions directly. Usually claimed generalizations are supported by data from polls, but Pro has produced none of that. Instead Pro asks me to read a list of assorted links, try to figure out what he means by “ignorant” and “hypocrisy,” and that then I should try to figure out what his argument is. Republicans leadership has consistently blamed oil prices on development prohibitionsAt the start of the debate Pro said, \"It is hypocritical for Republicans to blame rising gas prices on Obama and not give him some credit when they go down.\" For that to be hypocrisy, Pro would have to show that Republicans believe that nothing effects oil prices, and that Obama is → Token: given → Label: refutes\n"

CON has yet to actually argue this debate, and it is now closing statements.I do not refute CON's history lesson. Rather I wonder what it has to do with the resolution. What does Lincoln's stance on slavery have to do with modern GOP ideology? CON is wasting his time, my time, and the audience's time by stating a laundry list of historical detail that has no direct pertinence to the resolution.R7) CON's paragraph on \"limited government\" is so convoluted that he confuses himself. He utilizes the terms \"conservative\" and \"Republican\" interchangeably:\"Conservatives favor policies that maintain the status quo; that is why modern republicans are attracted to a strict constitution.\" ...only to conclude that \"Republicanism and conservatism is not the same thing\". I am disappointed that we are not debating the resolution. CON is having trouble with simple sentence structure, to say nothing about forwarding a case. R8) CON continually confuses \"rule of law\" and \"majority rule\" in his framework.

In fact Ronald Reagan would be an awesome symbol for the GOP, irrational fears and all. 3. It's not that Yosemite has been inaccurate shooting his pistols. Watch any time Sam has shot the guns.

Him showing that a party insider can back a losing candidate doesn't help his case either.

      "Evidence: Thanks, also, for yours. Indeed it was Luke. I should have taken the time to research that. No matter, Luke was then Inspired to write that one must be 'ordained'. Obviously this doesn't mean that each of us must become a legal minister, but rather that we each are obligated to become baptised, as according to the Gospel. Corinthians 15: 1 - 4, also states that \"...I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you...\" The Gospel thus also includes that which Jesus has preached (or lived), in many cases. And Jesus has adamantly supported, preached and instructed upon Baptism. As such, it is an obligation of the Gospel In Matthew 28:18-20, Jesus commands all people, in becoming His disciples, to be taught His word and be baptized. It is thus an essential part in becoming a Disciple of Christ. You are correct about it actively bringing Salvation to those whom peruse it. But this does not mean that Baptism isn't mentioned (and obligatory) in the Gospel. In fact, Baptism has a strict protocol in which has been specified clearly in the Bible. If it were so trivial, why would God go to such bother? Baptism is most assuredly not necessary in becoming a Christian, but it is obligatory in becoming a sound Disciple of Christ.

I'm going to be interested in seeing what his rebuttal of my main argument will be. Let's go through what he said. The reasons there are differences in the genealogies between Matthew and Luke is because Matthew's genealogy is focused on tracing the legal decent of the House of David (which is why the genealogy starts with Abraham; the patriarchs were the beginning of that line of heirs to the throne of the House of David), while Luke is focused on showing Jesus' relationship to the entire human race (which is why his genealogy goes back to Adam). They aren't complete genealogies, but considering the contents of the rest of their books, I doubt that Matthew and Luke were setting out to write a complete genealogy. Frankly, this topic isn't something that greatly interests me, and I don't know too many people in the general populous that care any more than I do.

      "Evidence: I shall provide a brief rebuttal to Pro’s previous round.“Con's assertion that the line of argument I have chosen is \"less effective\" is a clear case of begging the question.”By claiming Pro’s 3rd round less effective, have I committed a case of ‘begging the question’?. I don’t believe so. I have given reasons (round 4) as to why I think his 3rd round wasn’t so effective which support my claim as a valid contention rather than a fallacy. I further support my reasons by an example within the same round.“Again, I am willing to answer the points my opponent has raised in another medium where my answer will not distract from the main issue of the debate.”The ‘main issue’ of this debate is the consistency in the gospels regarding Jesus (especially in their portrayal of his divinity). My burden a. is to prove the gospels are not all consistent in this regard and b. to rebut Pro’s evidences of Christ’s divinity in Mark. Both of which I have continued to do so only up until round 3 and a bit of 4, because Pro simply refuses to continue or offer anymore rebuttals, answer them or concede. Rather he claims he has a response available to be provided elsewhere. I’ve already explained how this is an unfair tactic in my previous round. There is a reason why this debate is formatted at maximum flexibility (i.e. no → Token: given → Label: refutes\n",

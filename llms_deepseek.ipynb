For instance, what if anything goes wrong in the method? Could people in the society incidentally get killed? Or could it be deliberate? The thing is, that cloning is already out there! You may not apprehend it because people or critters look the same as cherished ones or beloved creatures! Something may go wrong in the making and in a second the feeling of the person or creature could change (Clones don't have emotions! They are like robots!) and maybe someday clones will overtake our atmosphere! It may seem pretty absurd what I am transcribing, but I can assure you to be in my faction! To say that cloning is immoral and that we should discover an innovative way to help people exist longer with natural resources and 'human' elements! For one, there are health perils going into this manner! There are also emotional risks and there could be undiscovered consequences. There could be a mutation of a human's body and a canine's head! It could happen! Another reason that cloning is dangerous is because there will be too many people on earth! Clones can not depart unless killed. The administration would not have enough funds to maintain all of these people! Another large reason to not consider cloning is because clones do not care about religion! Consider it or not, we all have a religion even if you think that you don't! If you were a clone, you could probably not have children! They can not make a clone have the same parts as a natural human being! Clones are manufactured! The whole process messes with our ecosystem! These are the reasons that cloning should not follow! Accept it or not! Cloning certainly does exist, and its pretty frightening!\n",

      "Evidence: I see no reason why these people should not be allowed to protest. Everyone should have a right to have let their opinion be known. If we selectively choose what people can say, then how is there really any free speech. And while I understand that you want the debate to about morals, it's hard to talk about what is clearly a free speech issue without bringing the government in. But I will try my best. I think that the crux of the matter is your definition of morals. You have decided that it is immoral for these to people to picket the funeral. Why? What basis do you have for this claim? The people who protest often feel that it is their moral obligation to do so. The members of the Westboro Baptist Church are trying to draw attention to what they perceive to be the moral deficiencies of the rest of the nation. Thus, they feel that they are morally justified in what they are doing. And who exactly made you the decider of what is moral and what is not? Morals are all relative to the individual; what you perceive as morally wrong they perceive as morally correct. Think of it this way: would it be right for me (a Jew) to proclaim that all Christians are immoral because they believe that Jesus was the son of God? I think that an unbiased observer would say that it isn't right. Just because I disagree with their morals doesn't make them immoral. In conclusion, although we can use our own morals to judge others, we have no right to objectively and definitively say that we are right and someone else is wrong. No one has given us this power. Furthermore, the idea of freedom of speech and expression is worthless if we decide that only some people have a right to it.\n",

Regardless of the potential unhip nature of some rule of etiquette, etiquette is essential to any civilization. The basic behavior that is accepted in social situations can mean the difference between success and failure in almost every aspect of life. Pushing norms of society, being avant garde, can be described as a positive attempt to express yourself. Wearing a hat may express some facet of your personality, or some artistic expression.

      "Claim: Should we be involved in the war in Irag!\n",
      "Evidence: To conclude this debate I will respond to the individual points that you have mentioned, as well as supply a final recount of various reasons why the United States should not be involved with a war in Iraq. First, I disagree that the United States was attacked because of our supposed religion. I do believe that many middle eastern counties see us as immoral (due to our separation of Church and State, our \"liberal\" politics and laws, American policies of expansion and severe interest in our power/economic gains, etc etc etc). However our involvement in the war only increases their negative image of us. Plus, I'm not even entirely sure that the American government didn't have anything to do with 9/11, although that's another debate entirely. The point is that terrorists attack Israel more frequently than the U.S. not because they're afraid of us... I mean, suicide bombings mean that they're going to die anyway, so what the Hell are they afraid of?! Instead, I argue that attacks on Israel occur more frequently because 1) the proximity of middle eastern countries (and the terrorists within them) to Israel and, 2) the long-standing conflict with Israel since its inception (because of it's Holy Land). You mentioned that America is seen as the police force of the world. My rebuttal is that being considered a police force of the world may not be a good thing at all. First, perhaps our policing has helped contribute to the perception of the United States as the Evil Empire, and one reason why many terrorists groups hate us in the first place. Second, there is an extremely limited number of countries in the world (especially the United Nations) that agree with us embarking on this war. Thus, we are not seen as do-gooders helping to SAVE people, but rather \"bad cops\" (since you used the analogy of policing) who are using our powers for evil or for our own selfish agendas. We are alienating our allies one by one, including powerful ones in the middle east -- how is that benefitting our country at all? And in response to our so-called \"responsibility\" to countries with people who don't have our exact freedoms, my question is: Is war really the answer? There wasn't a better way? As a result of this war, countless soldiers and civilians have died, not to mention the entire American economy is in shambles. We have so many debts to foreign nations; again this is a HORRIBLE move politics wise. But in terms of moral obligation, I pose the question- Who are we to determine what rights and freedoms other countries should have? After all, Holland has had marijuana legalized for years, whereas it is not legal in the United States. Is Holland giving us a hard time about it? No. Countries in Europe have also legalized gay marriage YEARS before the United States even considered it. Are they telling us what to do and how to run our country? No. Granted these things may all seem trivial to the torture imposed upon Iraqi civilians under Saddam Hussein. However are we forgetting the torture that America has imposed upon its own citizens in the past? Slavery anyone? The Civil Rights Movement? Being attacked by German Shepards and bludgeoned to death by police officers for fighting to sit at the front of the bus hardly seems humane to me. Yet other countries did not impose upon our affairs. Likewise there are countless instances in American society where as a nation we have acted cruel and unfairly (I won't get into that). The point is that most countries see international war as a last resort, and is considered just only in dire circumstances, such as if your country is put in severe danger. Our country was attacked, yes. But not by Iraq. By the Taliban; al Queda. Fight THEM. Continue the war against TERRORISM. But no, you cannot just go to war with known countries that house terrorists. Because guess what - the U.S. houses them too. And while certain countries may come off as 'potential threats' due to that fact, just imagine about how much of a threat the United States appears to be since we 1) apparently find it within our right to police the world and go to war despite the support of the United Nations, and 2) we proudly boast about our WMDs even though we are hypocritical enough to invade countries because of the possibility that other nations may have them. Even if Iraq DID have WMDs (which they did not... and we were lied to about it repeatedly), why are they more of a threat then the United States who has proven that we will attack a country randomly for whatever reason? Bottom line: Other countries (even enemies) have WMDs. We do not attack them because they pose more of a threat to the U.S. than Iraq did. Iraq was a relatively easy target; it's not right of the U.S. to use its military prowess to infringe upon the rights of an inferior country. We wouldn't want people telling us how to run our country, yet we are that egotistical that we have that right over others? I'm sure that many people in other nations would feel that the Death Penalty and killing someone via electric chair is inhumane. But that is for the American people and the American government to decide. Imagine war being declared upon us, and American civilians dying in the streets because people of other cultures disagreed with our laws and way of life. Middle-eastern culture is completely different from ours; cultures change and evolve at their own pace over time constantly. Why don't you look up ancient Roman practices and other cultural behavioral patterns from the past and then come talk to me about history. And finally, I'll recount my reasons + add some new ones on why this war is wrong: the number of casualties (from all sides); the cost of this war and its effect on the American economy and policy + way of life; the negative repercussion regarding how the world views America, i.e. al Qaeda and other terrorist groups can cite this as an example of the U.S. taking over the world and our need to be stopped/punished... plus other world powers seeing America as a bully who will stop at nothing to get our way; fighting in Iraq has slowed the production of oil, causing gas prices all over the world to sky rocket and cause more economic problems for us Americans at home, etc. The list goes on and on. Like I said, there are (a FEW) legitimate reasons for the United States to be at war with Iraq. However like I have mentioned in a previous round, the cons far outweigh the pros. So, I would like to thank everybody for reading, Marine_to_be for debating, and would like to ask everyone to keep in mind that regardless of your position on this issue, to please vote based on who has given the best arguments and performed better in this particular debate. Thanks!\n",

      "Evidence: My opponent has seemed to veer completely off track. Almost all of his last argument was devoted to showing why he thinks God is evil. As much as I would love to debate that, I must adhere to the resolution at hand. Thus far, my opponent has given no solid evidence as to why you should not believe in God. As the instigator, he has completely blown off his burden of proof. \"First I will say the miracles performed by Jesus in the new testament also break the laws of physics but you still choose to believe this man did them even though it is impossible.\" You seem to have missed my last point. These things are impossible through natural means. Therefore, a supernatural entity is necessary. Jesus was not an ordinary human bound by the laws of physics. \"Ok how was god created if matter can not be created then it means that he couldn't have been created to create matter and if matter cannot be created how did he create it so how can he exist.\" Again, He is not bound by the natural laws of science, since He created them. (And everything else on this Earth for that matter) Much like a cartoonist binds his artwork to the page, so has God bound us with physics. God can (and obviously has) create(d) matter because He is not physically bound. \"Also if the universe needs a cause then why doesn't god need a cause[sic]\" I'll take the hit for an ad-hominum. You really aren't getting the idea here are you? As your Richard Dawkins will tell you, matter does not spontaneously burst into being. He will also tell you that he knows that he exists, and has matter. We can then deduce that his matter did not spontaneously burst into being because it is physically impossible. Mr. Dawkins will then tell you that he doesn't know how the universe started, but that he knows what kind of event must have taken place. (See previously posted video) When asked if God is a possibility, he says that he cannot prove that God doesn't exist, simply because God is non-falsifiable. This is true. However, he still leaves a gaping unanswered question of how matter came into existence. Physically, it is impossible. I should not exist, you should not exist, and even the great Richard Dawkins should not exist. Funny story though, he exists. So do you, and so do I. If we exist, and we could not have gotten here by natural means, then we must have arrived by something greater than natural means. Could the answer possibly be a....... supernatural being? God? Until my opponent can provide me with a valid alternative answer, he has no case. I therefore rest mine. The resolution remains affirmed.\n",

      "Evidence: I don't know why my opponent forfeited, but I hope it is nothing serious. Well, since my opponent forfeited I think I'll keep to my arguments with some small additions. There is no reason why we should keep halloween with all its pagan and religious ties. Although I guess I can understand why people like the \"evil\" and \"scary\" themes I don't see why we can't just turn it into a day to scare or prank people. The whole \"demons from the other\" world can just be left. It would still be essentially the same expect with a different name and it won't confuse toddlers. Of course I don't think halloween it this great threat to society, but I think we should just drop the pagan stuff. I mean some people so believe in \"magic\" and have dark magic \"cults\" where people do actually get hurt. Like it is now halloween make these things seem a little more acceptable. It makes children more eager to try it out, just in case they are a wizard. Also, dropping the pagan ties we allow children from religious families to join in in the fun. I know some of them do, but halloween is against most religions and I know atheists will say that if \"dumb religious people\" don't want to join in we don't need to change it for them, but those children did not chose in which families they were born into and it just causes conflict for them. In conclusion, I think we should not celebrate halloween and that we can just create a new holiday which is essentially the same without the pagan and religious ties. It will still be fun and religious children can join in too without having to deal with conflict from their families.\n",

The support of abortion on demand, the redefinition of the family and the support of homosexual marriages, opening the military up to people who engage in a particular sexual practice, the confiscatory nature of our taxing and spending system, and perpetual wars do not endear me to what the flag now represents. Adding \"one nation under God\" does not cancel these moral outrages. In fact, it would not surprise me that liberals don\"t care that much about the Pledge including \"under God\" because its addition appeases many Americans. The courts have ruled that \"In God We Trust\" can stay on our money, and \"under God\" is still in our Pledge. God is in heaven, and everything is right with America. Wrong. The people of Israel cried out, \"This is the the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord\" (Jer. 7:4) thinking that all was right with their nation. In the same verse, God described such a belief \"deceptive words.\" Read more at http://godfatherpolitics.com...\n",

      "Claim: should we choose between history and geogrphy as cousrses\n",
      "Evidence: I still don't fully understand the topic, but I will continue to debate. Sadly, my opponent has wasted a round and he has not presented any arguments or stated his stance. So, I will be assuming the stance that we should mandatorily study geography and history. In order to get my point across, I would like to present one reason each why the studies of geography and history are both important. First off is geography. Argument 1: We should study geography because it helps in the modern world when students grow up. For example, many people in today's world do not know where basic states and countries are. For example, in the video that can be found at , Harvard students were interviewed and asked what the capital of Canada was, and none of them knew. Also, in this video titled \"Why we need to teach geography\", () 8th and 12th graders were given geography assessments. 74% of 8th graders had a basic geography understanding, and only 24% had a proficient geography understanding, while a mere 3% had an advanced level geography understanding. And in 12th grade, the percentages were even lower. In the same video, Americans were asked simple geography questions that they could not answer. This is impactful because it shows that we need to stress teaching geography and history in schools. Next, history. Argument 2: We should study history because, once again, it helps with understanding of the world, especially with government officials. You know that little kid who lives down the street? He could grow up to be the next president, or congressman, or even mayor, but he was never taught history, so he has no idea how a government is run, let alone how to run his own. He influences higher individuals (if he isn't president) in his wrong running ways, and tears the country into shreds. If this isn't a strong enough example for you, watch the video linked here, . This video shows Americans asked why we celebrate the 4th of July, and, no surprise, they simply could not answer it. This is impactful because this argument shows how we need geography. Since I have now shown why both history and geography are vital to be taught, I believe I have won this debate. So, a message to all voters: vote for me! I wish luck to my opponent in the voting polls and hope that the roll my way. Good luck Con!\n",

      "Evidence: I think that there has been a miscommunication. You seem to think that I am arguing for forcing these people to accept Western culture. But I am not. I meant to make that clear when I said that western culture is not necessarily the best thing, so we shouldn't compel them to live like us. All I am arguing for is spreading the gospel. But you seem to think that they have already heard. As proof you say that their ancestors had to have been told at some time in history. This may be true, I do not know. But what I do know is that that doesn't mean that this generation has heard. They need a chance too. But would they even consider exchanging their religion for Christianity? Would I accept a belief that Aliens told me about? (I do not accept the \"not scientific\"proof\" part.) No, I would not. But in the past, tribes have changed. Look at the Huaroni, for example. So it may be that they will change, and it would be wrong to refuse them the chance. But should we get involved in other nations issues? Let me put it this way. You have a dog in your house which you force to stay inside. It has no idea that there is a world outside. If I come and give it walks, would that be wrong? You would probably say yes because it is your dog, not mine. You'd say that you should be able to do what you want with it. But these are people, not dogs, and that makes a very big difference. If you were to keep your daughter inside like that, she would most likely be taken away from you. Yes, I have read \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" In it it spoke of harming and cruely treating innocent men. I am proposing doing the opposite. I say we should treat these people like we would want to be treated, not forcing them to stay in their cage of ignorance, not keeping them in the dark. How is that \"potentially harming them\"\"? The only example you found was westernizing them. But what I have been proposing is giving them Jesus, medicine, food, shelter, and anything else they need. You are proposing forcing them to stay uncontacted, I am proposing giving them a choice. Thanks for your arguments. They made me really think a lot more than I would have on my own. Good luck!\n",

      "Claim: Should we continue the practice of solitary confinement in the United States criminal justice system\n",
      "Evidence: 1. I agree with the definition of solitary confinement; however, I would also like to add that they are allowed to see/interact with prison guards.2. If a person is placed into solitary confinement, then they will be properly disciplined. 3. Solitary confinement is not entirely immoral nor is it unethical because of its intention of disciplining someone. 4. Being disciplined is good.5. All other negative consequences of solitary confinement, such as: damaged psyche, being unable to 'properly' integrate back into society, and deviating from society's norms with new mental instability, are acceptable in light of the benefits of being disciplined. 6. The eighth amendment states: “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.” 7. Solitary confinement cannot be considered cruel and unusual punishment because it might be harmful to one’s psyche. It is not a definite outcome of being placed into solitary confinement. 8. Regarding the statistic “…A third of the population in solitary confinement are made up of mentally ill people,” does that reflect our current time, or the past? Because in the past, prior to the eighth amendment, people that were mentally ill were considered a danger to society, so they incarcerated them. Thereafter, the ‘cruel and unusual’ part of the eighth amendment was created. If it is allowed, then it does not violate the eighth amendment. 9. I do not agree with it being a social burden. How is this a social burden if the prisoners are being placed in isolation? They are no longer a burden if they are out of sight. 10. Americans pay enough taxes on prisons and prisoners now, how is ‘fixing them in a way society can see them as able to join the free population’ going to lessen that amount? It won’t – it will only add to the massive amount of taxes each American citizen already has to pay. 11. There are other ways to integrate them back into society. For example look at a soldier returning home for war that's been diagnosed with PTSD. The mental state is clearly unstable; however, after some time they are able to socialize with society again. How? Because of their influences they have in their life. With the right motivation and incentive a person can accomplish whatever they want. 12. Forms of solitary confinement are used in every day life and work; for instance, children -- (instead of being hit) they are placed in a corner for an hour or two. These tactics are used for discipline. _________________________________________________________________________________________________ 13. Therefore, solitary confinement is necessary, and we should continue the practice of it. Non-controversial: premise 1 is stating, and adding to, the definition of solitary confinement. Premise 2 is a casual claim; therefore, it cannot be controversial. Premise 6 is what the eighth amendment states, nothing is being argued there. Premise 8 is asking for additional clarification because pro’s premise was too vague to determine what was meant by “…a third of the population.” Controversial: All other premises can be refuted and argued. None of my arguments have accurate evidence to support the claims; however, it is based off of common knowledge -- what that may be considered will vary depending on the person. Premise 9 is a question, but is also followed by a subjective statement, and it can be argued.\n",

      "Claim: Should we cut Welfare\n",
      "Evidence: Here is is my rebuttal: 1. My opponent says that welfare works because 80% of the people who use it usually just take 5 years to find another job. What about the other 20% that are taking this to the long term because 5 years is not a long time. By middle class life I guess opponent has not just meant the vital things needed (running water, electricity, a house, food supplies, etc.), but also several luxuries you get in middle class life. Some Americans on welfare have great housing while receiving unemployment checks at food stamps, but are abseloutly making no attempt to find a job. In fact one baker was asked by a woman to make a cake that looked like her new designer purse. When the baker told her it would cost 150 dollars she asked if he takes food stamps. 2. I do agree with my opponent that we need more stable funding and need to make sure that these people on welfare are actually looking for jobs. As for educational assistance I think that we need to send the people who need it back public schools or schools for just adults that need to look back at education. We should fund educational assistance, but make sure we have the capability to teach all these people without going over the needed capacity which would cause more government funded teachers to be around than needed. 3. What we must do is find out who and why these vendors are giving out welfare claims to people who need them. It is possible that they are just doing it so they can make themselves useful. That goes for the 93% that my opponent claimed that are abusing welfare. This is why we need more detail on the other 7% that find other ways to get welfare without needing it. In closer I have found this: \"It is morally wrong for the government to take money from people and redistribute it to those who they say are in need (i.e. more likely to vote for them). Having said that I want to emphasize that I am not against charity. Just the opposite, I believe it is the duty of every man to help out his fellow man as he is able but I am very much opposed to public welfare. Let me put it on the very personal level. If some poor fellow comes up to me in the street and asks me for some help feeding his family and getting medical help for Tiny Tim (who is a cripple), perhaps I will be moved with compassion and want to help. I would then reach into my pocket and see if I have anything there that would help. But maybe he needs a friend or a teacher and I could be that person to make a difference in his life. Maybe my efforts to restore this guy who is down on his luck could change both our lives. But the least I could do is give him a few bucks. But let's say I don't have the means or interest in helping out this guy. Is it okay for me to go to you, beat a few dollars out of you and give it to him? No, it's not. That is theft. Perhaps a well-intentioned theft but theft nonetheless.\" http://www.youtube.com... http://shine.yahoo.com...\n",

Even still geocentrism holds some wait, \"Recent polls have suggested that one in four Americans are unaware the Earth revolves around the sun\"(www.rawstory.com) But know one in their right mind would want to debate with Geocentrists, the obvious solution is to Stress and increase Educational efforts about the issue. So my point is that we treat creationism In the exact same way. My opponent said we cede ground to and lose the apathetic and undecided voters by demeaning them. This would be true if debate was the only way to validate and further ones side. But increased awareness and stress education under the pretext of science denial is much more preferable than debates that just assure ideological entrenchment.\n",

      "Claim: Should we eat death row prisoners as meat\n",
      "Evidence: Con quoted-\"Prisoners who are executed are abominations to society, but the family is not responsible for what they have done so they have a right to bury them. After a human being is executed, whether or not you like it, they were someone so they should be able to get a proper burial.\" Argument-I never said the family is responsible for those criminals, but who said that they should be buried and why it is important. It is just a ritual which is created by the society and men. FACT- Burial is very bad and has many demerits- 1- The embalming process is toxic. 2 -Many materials go into a process. 3- Memorial parks use a lot of space and resources. 4- Funeral are very expensive. http://www.techinsider.io... So you realize that it is better to eat them and not to bury them and they were just criminals who SHOULDN'T be given a proper burial( burial has many demerits). Con quoted -\"If he is your father, and he claims his innocence and then he is eaten how would you feel then? He could be wrongly convicted\"- Argument- You are talking about a situation which is 1 in 100 and GENERALLY actual culprits are only given death sentences, but exceptions exist everywhere, can't help. Con quoted- \"Eating someone does not do anything, therefore there is absolutely no point in eating them.\" Argument- Why eating someone doesn't do anything. It is good because- 1- Many people will get a new dish, food and taste to eat, the same way we get by eating an animal. 2- Many people will get food. 3- Anyways men eats every living thing which is able to move so why not criminals. 4- It's better than burying them as I said above. Con quoted- \"There is a huge difference between eating another humans flesh and eating an animals. Humans are humans, they walk, talk, and are somehow associated with our society. Animals on the other hand, are needed to provide the proper amount of protein\" Argument- 1-Why there is a huge difference in eating a man and eating an animal. So what that men can walk, talk, and are associated to our society. Animals also walk, communicate, and are associated to their animal kingdom. 2-Just because you think that Man is the most superior of species. This is wrong. 3-Who gave you the right to eat animals. Just because some early evil men decided to do so and the society is carrying on the same tradition, It doesn't mean that something is right. 4-Just because we have our brains developed then animals, it doesn't give a right to us to eat them. Con quoted- \"As they have proven, eating human flesh is addictive, but most people who go through withdraw from regular meat are going through it because they have a sudden lack of protein. That is the key difference: Human Flesh is totally unneeded l, whereas regular meat eaters go through a lack of protein withdraw\" Argument- 1- There are crores of vegetarians in the world who are healthy and not have a lack of proteins. 2- If you think you have a lack of proteins then there are many vegetarian food which are very good in proteins and eating meat is certainly not the only option left. 3- Non vegetarians are on a sudden lack of proteins when they leave non veg food but that is because they were consuming non veg food in the first place. Why? 4- Non vegetarians only eat meat because they crave for its taste and are addicted to eat that and cover this fact by giving the reason of PROTEINS. 5- Veg food rich in proteins- Rice and Wheat, pulses, soy beans, corns, carrot, milk, egg, etc. Con quoted-\"Let me ask you this, would you eat human flesh? Your answer is probably No , right? Chickens are not human beings. They can not think for themselves and probably aren't even aware that they exist. Just think about it, you can play the \"why\" game all you want, but pigs, cows, chickens, etc have been eaten since the dawn of time, but even way back when, cannibalism was still frowned upon. It isn't my fault that people are starving in Congo, how is that even relevant?\" Argument- 1- Chickens are not humans, cannot think for themselves, and also don't know that they exist but that doesn't mean they are not contributing to the society. They are maintaining the ecological balance for you and me to survive. And anyways WHO gave you the right to eat other living being. source- https://www.reference.com... 2- Yes I agree that pigs, cows, chickens, etc have been eaten since the dawn of time but that doesn't make it a RIGHT practice and tradition. does it? ex- Prostitution has also been there since the dawn of time and mankind but then also today it has been banned in many parts of the world. 3- Cannibalism has been frowned upon since ages but that is again created by society and as I said in my previous debate argument, that you grow up believing in what the society teaches you, whether it is right or wrong. 4- It is definitely your fault and fault of every non vegetarian in this world that people around the world are dying because of lack of food. explanation- People demand non veg food, so these animals are deliberately bred and multiplied in huge numbers. Where these animals should have been 100 naturally, now they are 5000 in number. Now in order to feed them and make them healthy so people can consume them, they are given the veg food and water which would have otherwise been given to the humans, and hence people in poor countries are dying because of lack of food. Statistics say that vegetarian food for 20 people = non veg food for 2 people. So, definitely you all non vegetarians are responsible for hunger and deaths in poor countries like Somalia, Congo, etc, because you all are addicted to that taste. aren't you? Please refer these and you will understand my point and explanation completely- Con quoted-\"Like I said earlier, there is a big difference between a wild animal and a executed prisoner. A heard of wild Buffalo will kill you in the wild, so by your logic they are useless to society. This is a moral question, we don't eat humans because they are humans, and in a way wouldn't that like be killing them twice? Humans are humans, wild animals are wild\" Argument- 1- A heard of wild buffaloes will kill you in the wild because their mind is not as developed as humans but that doesn't mean you should kill and eat them for your food purposes. As I said they are doing their contribution to the environment. And any sane and logical man would not go into the wild without any protection, I believe con! But yes you can kill anyone to save yourself, may be an animal. No, it wouldn't be killing them twice as I said, BURYING them has many disadvantages so just eat them right? Con quoted- \"Prisoners are still humans, wild animals are not. Wild animals will try to kill you in an instant, just like a prisoner would. You wouldn't eat a human, but you would eat meat so don't be a hypocrite\" Argument- 1- I am just saying either you eat both prisoners and animals or don't eat any of them, that's it. I didn't get why you are calling me a hypocrite. I am pretty clear on my words. 2-And humans eat chicken, goat, cow, fish, camel, who are friendly and very good pets, These animals are not wild and would not kill you in an instant. 3-Humans around the world generally don't consume any wild animals but these innocent pets and animals are there favorite dishes, so you first get the FACTS. Con quoted-\" We are the most superior species, we aren't living in the jungle anymore and are far more intelligent than other animals. Can most animals cook and clean or think for themselves? No. Argument- 1- Yes I agree with you, we are the most intelligent species and aren't living in the jungle anymore, but we are definitely NOT the most SUPERIOR because- a) Humans are doing everything (development in every field, growing, increasing their potentials, etc) only for themselves and not for anybody else. They are doing this to satisfy their greed and curiosity and not so that everybody can live at peace. Poor are still dying but other human doesn't give a damn. In animals, all are equal. b) Humans are criminals like murderer, fraud, rapist, robber, thugs, goons, etc., whereas no other specie is. c)Humans are the most GREEDY species on the planet.All other species just use what they need and leave the rest for others but we try to take everything for ourselves. d)Human communities are never at peace. There are wars, caste, discrimination, competition, etc which is not seen in animals and other species e)Human species is the only specie where- A single person is responsible for killing millions. This is not seen in animals. f) Humans living in cities pollute the environment the maximum and very badly because of which global warming is raising habitats are getting destroyed and even animals and tribals are being affected rigorously due to this. So definitely humans ARE NOT the most SUPERIOR species INTELLIGENT of all, YES. - NO ANIMAL is responsible for extincting other animals. It's only we humans. Con is not clear about the facts and framing wrong statements to win. - Eating animals and not eating humans is normal because society has taught us that and we are grown seeing this BUT that DOESN'T NOT make it right or the IDEAL thing. - According to con if every prisoner eater is a killer than - every non-vegetarian is also a killer,.(of animals) -I am just saying that- There is nothing wrong in eating death row prisoners as I have explained in all my points above. I conclude by - -Either you eat both- animals and humans or you don't eat anyone. http://www.bustle.com... http://www.peta.org... Con just has psychological reasons in his arguments but I have given solid ones. Voters, please think something new and don't focus on the tradition path.\n",

      "Evidence: Pro has once again ignored the quantitative evidence I provided showing that the Federal Reserve has immensely benefited the stability of the American economy through its monetary policy, more than *halving* the time the country has spent in recessions. That is a huge impact, and Pro has conceded it. . 1. Pro has not provided a source to indicate that Congress's passing of the Federal Reserve Act was \"mindless\". Dismiss his baseless claim. 2. I have no obligation to go fact-finding for Pro. He made the assertion that the Fed directly caused two of the biggest economic crises in US history, so he needs to back that up with solid evidence. All he has provided so far is some theoretical mechanism by which the Fed *could* have caused those crises. Reject this argument as a bare assertion. 4. As demonstrated in the CNN article from last round, people in general do not like the idea of their tax money being used to bail out banks, yet bailing the banks out was absolutely necessary to prevent economic collapse from ensuing. What the Fed did both saved the economy and prevented an increase in public distrust of the government. It was wholly justified. 5. Richard Nixon is the one who took the US off the gold standard. Eliminating the Fed for Nixon's alleged transgression of the Constitution is completely absurd. This argument remains non-topical. 6. The source was linked at the bottom, along with my other sources. .. Pro has dropped this argument. 7. No, it's not common knowledge. I could just as easily say \"it's common knowledge that the Fed is a force for good in the economy\" and win the debate that way. Dismiss Pro's baseless claim. 8. Pro totally ignores my evidence that the Fed is NOT a private corporation, and that it IS limited by Congress in a manner similar to other federal agencies which make the majority of our laws. Pro has dropped this argument. 9. See 7 10. See 5 .\n",

      "Evidence: First off I do not understand why this is relevant, but to answer your question. Yes, I have been to an aquarium. It was honestly inspirational. It inspired me to get all of those creature out of there. They are intelligent and beautiful creatures. Humans are too, but are we kept in cages. On display for lions or zebras to come to see. No because we are soooo \"SPECIAL.\" I am honestly ashamed to be human when my own kind is doing torturous things to beautiful , helpless creatures. They speak exactly like we do, they all need to eat just like we do, so why exactly are they counted as not as important, as something that we can awe over, as something that does not matter as much as us. They are tested on, held captive, and even killed for human amusement. I say as long as they are getting held captive. Why exactly aren't we? And I don't mean because one of use commited a crime. I mean for no reason at all. Say you could breath water. Would you want to be cooped up in a little cage that will most liekly be crowded with a lot of other people that can breath water too? And be stared at in awe because you're at an aquarium. If I were a fish, I would find a way to rebel against people like you. The people who think that caging up helpless animals is alright. That as long as humans are being amused everything that animals are getting is just fricken fine.\n",

I say that if we want to live in a society where skin color doesn't matter, we shouldn't devote a whole month to any race. Plus, by making a whole month solely devoted to black Americans kind of gives the feeling to some that our country thinks that blacks are more important than any other race. Anyway, its not like we don't learn about other famous black people anyway, we learn about Harriet Tubman when we learn about slavery (but not the Civil War itself might I add), and we learn about Martin Luther King Jr. stopping segregation in the U.S. (but not how the cold war stopped us having a nuclear war with Russia) Overall, I think that these topics are important, but not important enough to have a whole month dedicated to a certain race.\n",

Also while it is true we have background checks and some limitations on firearms we could still have more. Also with the current laws we have, it is WAY to easy for anyone to get a gun by going to gun shows. Also, the current laws we have don't hold stores to these laws and they can easily break them with no punishment. You said that \"We need to protect our second amendment.\" but here's the thing gun control DOES NOT violate the second amendment. Why is because this is what the second amendment says \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. You see that gun control is not violating that because it is only making more background checks, and to make it as easy to buy a gun. It is not infringing on that right because you can still buy a gun it will just be harder. Please do your rebuttal for your next argument so things can move along smoothly thank you.\n",

I would also like to add that quite a lot of waste food can be composted and bread can be fed to wildlife so there are plenty of ways to minimize the amount of food waste that you throw out.

      "Evidence: Confidence is a huge part of life especially for teens. Uniforms look different on everyone. Some people may feel they don\"t look good in their school\"s uniform. Because of this feeling, they worry all day long about what everyone else is thinking of them. Having confidence can be of great importance. Weather it\"s a simple project presentation at school or a big job interview, confidence is key. While wearing uniforms, confidence is sometimes a hard thing to accomplish, but this isn\"t the only distraction of wearing a uniform. Uniforms can be quite distracting during the day because of all the restrictions. During the day you constantly have to worry about having your shirt tucked in and keeping everything according to code. While worrying about tests you are also constantly worrying about getting caught with a uniform violation. After enough uniform violations there will of course be consequences such as a detention. I personally am not always thinking about what I should be, but instead checking my uniform over and over to make sure not to get in trouble. Students have enough stress in their lives; why add more? With so much stress about getting good grades and getting everything done on time, we shouldn\"t have to deal with the stress of uniforms. Students already have so many things taken away from them during school hours, individuality and confidence shouldn\"t have to be hidden by uniforms. Having a few dress code guidelines is quite an easy fix to these issues. I believe that students should not have to wear uniforms.\n",

They aren't driven out because they just go to where they know there aren't hunting blinds. So animals can take care of themselves and as for you comment on humans having a higher population than any animal on earth here's some counter arguments. There are 19 billion chickens in the world, And animals in total make up more biomass on the plant than humans, humans average out at about 100 billion where animals are around 100 trillion. https://www.quora.com... https://www.npr.org...\n",

      "Evidence: The debate question posed is \"should we judge governments on economic performance\", and I am saying how can we not if they are involved in aspects of the economic performance of a country. It isn't limited to should we vote for parties based on their economic performance. In order for one to judge on a performance; a history of activity needs to have taken place. When judging something as important as a countries Government, I'd say there is a balance of things we would consider. Since the question you asking is limited to yes or no ultimately and since the Government is involved in aspects of the economy, we don't have a choice but to judge them on their performance in this regard where it fits. Also a Government is a group of leaders and it consists of members of different parties sometimes. People get chairs in Parliament who represent other parties but all strive to work together in Government even if the main party and President represents one party. When we vote, we vote for a party and we most certainly judge their performance but there may be a majority vote for a party that has had no performance or perhaps not a lot of performance in the leadership of a country but they able to influence the public in order to get majority votes. But does that mean we neglect to consider the current leading presidential party and their performance in all aspects including economy wise? Like I said before; when it comes to importing and exporting which is a very huge influence on an economy and what deals a country makes with other leaders of countries; this is something that lays on the top level of Government. In answer to what you have said here: 'Zimbabwe is an example I wouldn't put in this debate. The country is run by a dictator neither focused on the economy or his people' Whether he is focused on the economy or not; is something we would judge his performance on. There are many things that cause the economy to crash. One would be violence. So even if a leader is responsible for a war for instance, or contributes to his countries financial problems - we would of course take that into account. 'An example I would put to you is health care in the US. Something which certainly won't directly help the economy (although may do if people can work more), but drastically helps the lives physically and psychologically of those who previously couldn't afford health insurance' Obama's healthcare is going to come at a price. There are always conditions attached that may not actually benefit ALL the people in the end. I agree that we don't judge a Government solely on economic factors and performance but that is not the question you asked. I still say if the Government is involved in aspects of the economy which they are; we have no alternative but to judge them on their performance ALSO in this regard. ;-)\n",

      "Claim: Should We Keep The Electoral College\n",
      "Evidence: 1. “It is bad that we have a 2 party system and we do not give other parties a chance.” We don’t necessarily want other parties to have a chance. In Europe, Neo-Nazi activity is on the rise and is becoming a strong political movement [http://europe.newsweek.com...]. In the US, these ideologies still exist, but they cluster in one of our two main political parties. Those in the center, the center-right, the center-left, the far-left, the far-right, and libertarians, in the primaries, tend to back the establishment candidate. As the establishment wants to get elected, they tend to support the most palatable candidate, and generally that means moderate. While extremists on both sides of the isle express their discontent with compromise, no rational person should oppose a system that promotes moderation and compromise. A national popular vote, by making it easier for third parties to have a real shot at the presidency and gain political influence, would energize the radical base on both sides of the political spectrum, making political polarization even worse than it already is. A two party system encourages inter-party consensuses that promote, rather than prevent, ideological purity. In the 1990s, Democrats protested Clinton’s welfare-reform and 1997 tax cuts. But as they had no other party to turn to, they stayed put, were able to shift the party to the left, and create a progressive wave that led them to victory in 2008. In Germany, the dissenters to such compromises left the party, divided the base, and the feuding between the two leftist parties allowed the center-right party to take control [http://prospect.org...]. Allowing third parties to rise up would complicate the issues, create more bickering, and harm all ideologies. This far outweighs “giving people a chance.” 2. “States like California are unimportant because they are safe states. … do you think states like Wyoming or South Dakota receive 1 visit from either candidate, no.” Wyoming and South Dakota were visited last election. South Dakota was visited once, by Joe Biden, and Wyoming three times, twice by Romney and once by Michelle Obama [http://www.washingtonpost.com...]. A classic case of a “solid” state switching occurred in 2000. The number of registered Democrats in the state outnumbered the number of Republicans two to one. Only 4 times had a Republican ever won the state. Bush won the state by 6 percent because he spent an inordinate amount of time and money there [http://uselectionatlas.org...]. Had Bush lost West Virginia, he would have lost the election. But he was able to make a solid state flip sides--it is now considered a solid red state. This debunks my opponent’s entire argument. California is extremely important to candidates. As it has a huge population, doing well in California has a few good effects. (1) It lets you win the popular vote--although not actually important, it is good to have that on your resume; (2) The state has a huge hispanic population, and by doing well with that itinerant group it allows your party to do better when if they leave the state; (3) if you have a positive impact on the state, you help party members running for local positions (like Governor), and you help your party win Representative and Senate seats. Even if you won’t realistically flip the state, if you put enough effort in to increase your party’s favorability ratings, you would help the party in general--and if you were to win, make multiple new allies in congress. Even safe states, like Texas, NY, and California--are important under the EC system. 3. “You did say Virginia was a small state, if i may quote you, \"New Mexico, Virginia, New Hampshire, and Colorado,\" all small states, have a larger effect on voting outcomes than other states.” Whether or not Virginia is a small state is unimportant. The fact remains that voters in small states, like NM, CO, and NH, have a disproportionate impact on electoral results. The study measured, if you cast a vote in which state, where would it be most likely to change election results. Most of them happen to be small swing-states. However, on a pure weighting basis, you would probably want to move to Wyoming or Alaska to have your vote worth the most. 4. “Winner take all is unfair for states.” As I noted in earlier rounds, this argument is insane. (1) It is unfair because if someone votes for Romney, and Obama wins 50% + 1, all of Romney’s votes were wasted. This is literally my opponent’s argument. But this happens in every election no matter what. Say Romney won with 50% +1 of the popular vote under a direct popular vote. That means all of Obama’s votes would have been wasted! Does that mean elections are unfair? If this was the case, Romney would be co-president. “A” for effort I suppose. (2) This objection is refuted by my counterplan, that my opponent has dropped. 5. “This is not a debate about who would have ran this country better.” Stop claiming red herring when you are the one who brought the topic up. You are the one that mentioned the damage Bush brought to the country in the first place. You can’t say that the argument is irrelevant when you are the one that said it. It is unethical to blame me for going off track when it was you that got us here in the first place. 6. “The electoral college does not make it a battle over what the people like, but who the people in important states like.” Not who the important states like, but the states in general. The important states sway elections, but if the South decides not to vote, it doesn’t matter that Marco Rubio is the best NA and won Ohio, Colorado, Virginia, Iowa, Florida, New Hampshire, and Nevada--he would lose without the help from those “solid” states. The winner wins a majority of the states in general, not a select few “important” ones.\n",

Right now, some of you may be thinking \"Well let's set designated marijuana smoking rooms so there is no second-hand smoke to harm the community and the citizens who want pot can have pot.\" Your tax dollars at work, America. The only source I should need for this is \"Common Sense\" by Thomas Paine (Of course, I'm just being facetious). Smoking is bad. Smoking of any kind is bad. Even with health benefits, all of the harmful effects cannabis that I have mentioned more than outweigh the good. I would be alarmed to believe that after all this, the people stand firm on legalizing marijuana solely for taxation and the few health benefits it provides, with no regard whatsoever to the ulterior human health. Whether you are an addict, or a second-hand, it is very serious and should not just be legalized willy nilly. First it's pot. What's next? Oh, now America decriminalizes cocaine. Now heroin is legal. Hey guys, the gas station just started selling meth. Wanna get some? Marijuana is the gateway to all of this horror that will, ultimately, bring us to our knees (because we'll be too high to do anything!). Thank you for doing this debate with me.\n",

      "Evidence: First of all I would like to point out that the 260,000 dollar number is the cost for the kidney transplant when the patient is able to receive a kidney from the current system. Yes 260,000 dollars is a lot of money for the average American, but this isn't a debate about the cost of the procedure. It is about ways of acquiring a kidney to have the procedure done in the first place. My point was that the cost of acquiring a kidney in a market based system would not be that much compared to having the kidney transplant procedure. The broken window parable does not apply here. In the broken window parable only a few if any benefit. In a market based kidney system as in all market based systems everyone who participates in it will benefit. This is not a reverse robin hood scenario where the Rich steal from the poor. The is a voluntary system in which people are given a choice on whether or not to sell his or her kidney. People should have the opportunity to make their own decisions on whether or not to sell their kidneys. People who sell their kidneys aren't being forced to. They are willingly giving up one of their kidneys to save a life in return for some much needed cash. The seller benefits from the compensation and the buyer benefits from not dying. Just like any other market transactions it is a win win for both participates. As far as growing kidneys go the science is simply not there yet and probably won't exist for a couple decades. In the mean time many people will continue to die from thee shortage of kidneys caused from unjust laws banning kidney transactions. As this debate comes to an end I would like to state that people should be given the freedom to do anything with their body. Laws that ban kidney transactions are not only restricting individual freedom but is also causing the deaths of thousands in America alone.\n",

      "Claim: Should we let black people handle their dirty work\n",
      "Evidence: My opponent stated: \"and since nobody uses that kind of bullcrap invention, and nobody gives two sh\"ts about that monkey garrett morgan so it is an irrelevant point.\" Did he just say nobody uses that crap (meaning the traffic light)? I would like to think almost every single nation on the face of the planet uses traffic lights to organize traffic. My opponent stated: \"Hiu also had to audacity to mention something dumb as well pointing out that \"According to one source colonialism was one of the many causes of devastations of various ethnic people\" First of all, this just shows that whites are superior to other ethnic groups, because we are colonizing their territory and not vice versa. Also indians are irrelevant and dirtmonkeys in todays society. The government doesn't care about those mojenjotawokicherokeewapanoag motherfuckers.\" My point in citing colonialism was to highlight that in actuality the advent of colonialism, did more harm than good and many whites who \"expanded\" their influence needed these \"monkeys\" and \"indians to build their nations which their own citizens could not do on their own. As far as white European countries not being conquered, I guess you had forgotten the Turks and the Mongols who inhabited European lands for hundreds of years. My opponent said: \"This autistic being also tried to counter my point of crime rates in black scum neighborhoods but just pointed to statistics showing that 94% of black people were killed by blacks, WHICH PROVES MY POINT. (A bad thing about this is that only 6% of blacks are being killed by whites *sad face*)\" Actually if you go back, you are talking about black crime rates. The point was to highlight that people who are of the same demographic tend to kill each other because you live in close proximity. This has nothing to do with \"black crime\" because that would suggest these crimes would have racial undertones. I believe my opponent left out the fact that between 1980 and 2008 84 percent of homicides were \"white-on-white.\" Now before my opponent goes into a rampage and responds with (wait my opponent cannot respond because I have the last say, nevermind) \"well there are more whites\" the fact of the matter is if the discussion of so-called black-on-black crime is going to be discussed then we too must address the many whites who tend to kill other whites. According to one source: \"WHITE PEOPLE KILL MORE MEMBERS OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THAN ANY OTHER RACE Vulnerable populations are generally defined as children and the elderly. Family members and significant others are also often targets of homicide, rather than random victims. FBI homicide statistics from 1980 to 2008 show that white people are, by the numbers, far more likely to kill children and the elderly than any other race. Additionally, white people commit more sex-related and gang-related homicides than any other race.\" Also..... homicidebyrace FBI homicide statistics, 1980-2008 GANG MURDERS ARE MOST COMMON AMONG WHITE GANGS \"While a lot of attention has been given to the gang-related homicides in Chicago\"s predominantly-black South side, very little press has been devoted to covering the epidemic of white-on-white gangland murders. As the above chart demonstrates, the majority of gang-related homicides are committed by white people (53.3 percent white, 42.2 percent black), and the majority of white gang murder victims are also white (56.5 percent white, 40 percent black). Have this fact handy the next time someone bemoans \"black-on-black\" gang violence.\" Source: http://usuncut.com... My opponent said: \"Again my opponent just gives evidence proving my point, that black people are unqualified to the jobs when he said that \" White names triggered a callback rate that was 50% higher than that of equally qualified black applicants.\" and \"their study indicated that improving the qualifications of applicants benefited white applicants but not blacks, thus leading to a wider racial gap in response rates for those with higher skill.\" My opponent is intectually dishonest by leaving out the fact that blacks when compared to whites with the same qualifications, received less call backs due to the SOUND OF THEIR NAMES, not necessarily skill. The study clearly highlights that both black and white applicants had the same qualifications the only difference was their name, not their skill. My opponent said: \"Also yes I am a proponent of genocide for animals, its called extinction.\" Clearly my opponent in this entire discussion to which he deflected and could not refute my information is full of obvious hate. I have not only demonstrated that his position is not only racist, it bears no fact in reality. Clearly blacks are not animals since we do have many affluent Africans and African-Americans that contribute greatly to society. My opponents denial of successful blacks and their contribution to society is nothing short of delusional to which he has articulated that hate like that of a child (notice he said I had autism spectrum disorder) and little does my opponent know, is that there are succesful people in society that has autism. At the end of the day this debate was pretty much a slam dunk and I am sure most people would vote favorably for my arguments since my opponent provided little to no support for his position. Sadly there are many people that think like my opponent, however my opponent wants to think like me (e.g. His usage of the phrase \"My opponent\" in this round). Although my opponet has racist views it is quite comical because it really highlights his juevenile mentality...... BTW to my opponent: I am black, about to receive my second masters degree and I am also a medical professional and you lost to some random black guy in a debate........\n",

So I was asking myself what term should I serve if I worship people, places and things instead of worshipping and serving God. The bible tells us that God is very jealous for his people, he won\"t tolerate being 2nd or 3rd in our lives and this includes obedience to the voice of God\"s spirit. So what are you ignoring about God? Should you have stopped today and led someone to Christ, should you have given that money to the poor, should you have sacrificed your work life in favor of Gods plan for you today, should you have stopped working at religious outlets they call churches today in favor of truly following Christ\"s mission for you on this planet? If you wonder what\"s going to be the end result this is what Jesus said will happen Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.

Secondly, beyond this fact there is a much larger picture of the impact it has on society. Autists are to be kept separate from the rest of us humans and eye contact is one way to widen the isolation that keeps human civilization intact. As my opponent has mentioned autists are different to say the least and so to give them the same human interaction as much as giving them eye contact will only further the false belief within them that they too are human. Lastly, I would like to simply conclude by saying eye contact regardless is pointless as autists cannot comprehend the emotions coming with it and so it is better to preserve yourselves and humanity.\n",
